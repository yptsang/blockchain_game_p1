'BlockTrain': A Platform for Learning Blockchain ( PolyU &amp; HSUHK )

To spread knowledge of blockchain technology, an online educational game for learning blockchain concepts named ‘BlockTrainHK’ is designed and developed from the React Native framework. Users from multi-disciplinary backgrounds can experience the block mining process, where the whole journey of building the blockchain and other advanced concepts, including immutability, Merkle tree, and zero knowledge proof, can be revealed, such that technical barriers of learning blockchain can be overcome. 

In this repository, the entire learning game is packaged as a docker file for distribution and re-implementation. 

To faciliate the deployment of the proposed learning game, you may refer to the videos on Youtube:
